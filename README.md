Install UPM on the Edison, making sure to use a version that supports the APDS-9960 and ILI9341. Connect 2.8" LCD via SPI and APDS-9960 via I2C. Use one-way window film to create a one-way mirror. Cut out a small hole in the film for the APDS-9960. Adhere the Edison, LCD, and APDS-9960 to the back of the mirror.

Run the JavaScript code to get weather updates. Swipe your hand in front of the APDS-9960 to scroll between messages.
